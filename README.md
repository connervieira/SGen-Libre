## Description
SGen Libre is a free and open source port of SGen Desktop for GNU/Linux.

## Features
### Open Source
SGen Libre is completely open source, and all of the code can be reviewed and audited by anyone

### Rapid
SGen Libre can generate tens of thousands of passwords practically instantly due to its simple, low overhead design.

### Customizable
SGen Libre allows the user to customize which characters will appear in generated passwords, as well has how many passwords to generate and what their lengths should be. This makes it easy for administrators to generate hundreds of passwords that comply with certain password policy requirements.

### Efficent
Despite the high level of customizability, SGen Libre is still very simple and easy to learn. The main interface only contains 6 settings, and all of them are configured to use reasonable defaults, decreasing the chance you'll need to interact with them at all.

### Free
SGen Libre is free, both in terms of freedom and in cost. In other words, in addition to being able to download and use SGen Libre however you want, you can also study, modify, and distribute the source code under the GPLv3 license.
